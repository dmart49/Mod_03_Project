# European Soccer Hypothesis Testing and Analysis

## Introduction
---------------

Our project is aimed at interested gamblers who like to either place money into betting markets, or alternatively set betting markets for bookies. We are taking a look at a dataset of Europen Soccer Matches from the years 2008 to 2016, and analyzing a dataset with 296 teams, over 25,000 matches, aggregated FIFA data for both players and teams, and an analysis of 11 different countries with 11 total leagues.

In order to provide the most accurate insights for betting markets we wanted to answer some questions that could impact the predictions of future soccer events based on previous results.


## Installation
---------------

The Accompanying Dataset for this Project is the European Soccer Dataset. You can download it from [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer), you will need to unzip the archive and place the database in the root folder and rename to 'database.sqlite' for the code in the Notebooks to work.

## Overview
---------------

Once the database is set up, the Notebooks are the questions we answered throughout thi project
The questions include: 

- Question 1: Odds of winning a game at Home
- Question 2: Greater home field winning chances at home in England
- Question 3: Lack of wins at home in Scotland

An extra python file named 'functions.py' contains functions use in the Question 2 notebook.
